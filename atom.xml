    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have caught myself a few times lately, staring at my daughters, mouth agape, in wonder an awe about how quickly they are growing up. &nbsp;Time marches past us all with no regard to how much fun we are currently having - and like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbR7axof1wk">Ferris said</a>&nbsp;life moves pretty fast. &nbsp;You really need to stop and look around from time to time.</p>
<p>And it does move fast. &nbsp;A month ago marked the 1st anniversarry of my cousin Pete&#8217;s passing. &nbsp;Peter taught me many things about life, but the biggest of which is truly like that quote from the 80&#8217;s hit movie&#8230; life goes fast.</p>
<p>In the past year I have tried to make it a point, made it a <strong>goal</strong>&nbsp;in my life to stop and look around more often. &nbsp;Watch my girls grow in front of my eyes. &nbsp;Spend more time with those I love. &nbsp;And spend more time doing the things I love. &nbsp;It has been amazingly rewarding.</p>
<p>So with the summer break quickly running out of time, I decided to make some time, and &#8220;look around a little&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Fishmaster in Redding</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span>The first trip I took was down to Redding, CA to help my cousin pack up for a big move back to Spokane. &nbsp;Amanda is an amazing person who has been through so much in the past year, it was the very least I could do&#8230; and I was also really looking forward to hanging with her awesome kiddos too.</p>
<p>Time was made and spent doing fun things. &nbsp;Watching <em>Diary of A Wimpy Kid</em>, hanging with neighbors at a pool party, garage saleing, reminicing about Pete, and of course <a href="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/558276_10151187221920395_575272841_n.jpg" target="_blank">fishing with Ethan</a>. &nbsp;Nothing is more magical than hanging out with a kid that is doing what they love. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;Stop reading this blog post, and go out and do it, and be inspired.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/558276_10151187221920395_575272841_n.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Backpacking Bear</span></h3>
<p>I have been wanting to take Kaydee on her first &#8220;real&#8221; camping trip for quite sometime. &nbsp;No trailer, no car camping, the real kind. &nbsp;Hiking in, and enjoying nature. &nbsp;So a few weekends ago we did just so. &nbsp;Left home Friday afternoon, and went up to Little Three Creeks Lake. &nbsp;The hike wasn&#8217;t long - under 2 miles in fact, but it didn&#8217;t matter. &nbsp;We were camping.</p>
<p>My pack outweighed hers by 40lbs easily&#8230; but I would have been willing to carry 40 more for the experience. &nbsp;Setting up the tent, mac n cheese in a bag, climbing rocks in an alpine meadow, and skpping stones next to a bubbling spring - all of these moments and many more are priceless.</p>
<p>As I write this though, some of those magical spots are now being burned in the Pole Creek fire - I guess it was good we made time to get out there when we did - a whole one day before the fire broke out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazingly awesome weekend playing, in and around the Deschutes River. &nbsp;Sometimes I can&#8217;t believe how lucky I am to walk out my front door, walk 5 minutes, and be fishing in such a stunning place.</p>
<p>My stoke only got higher when I landed my first fish (minnow? &nbsp;it was like 5&#8221; long), and was equally as stoked when the second one (8 inches of pure furry) gulped up my parachute adams. &nbsp;So fantastic to be waded out in the river, casting away.</p>
<p>Finished up Saturday with a family bike ride to the park, a mere stroll from my little fishing hole.</p>
<p>Today I started off the day running down the river trail and then I got to fish the deschutes near FS road 40. &nbsp;The skeeters were fierce, and even without deet I managed to land a 9&#8221; brown.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Much.</p>
<p>Fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="imgs/2012-06-01-whole-wheat-banana-bread/545019f0ac2111e1b2fe1231380205.jpeg"></p><p>I have been trying some variations on a &#8220;Mom Classic&#8221; the past few weeks, and have finally refined the recipe down to something that is just waaaaay yummy. Teagan, in fact, just ate 3 pieces of this (thats a lot of fiber for a little one, bombs coming soon). <p /> So here is the recipe as it currently stands: <p /> * 1/2 Cup Organic Evaporated Cane Juice * 3 TSP Agave Nectar <p />  <br />* 2 cups (sifted first) Bob&#8217;s Red Mill Whole Wheat Flour <br />* 2 TSP Baking Soda <br />* 1/2 TSP Salt <br />* 2 Large Eggs <br />* 4 oz Organic Applesauce (no sugar added) <br />* 3 TSP Coconut Oil (melted) <br />* 4 Very Ripe Bananas (as my mom said this weekend, ripe ones are better than ones that have been in the freezer) <br />* 1 cup of Raisins <p /> Preheat oven to 350, and grease/flour a bread pan. <p /> 1) In a large mixing bowl, cream together sugar, agave, applesauce, coconut oil, and eggs. <p /> 2) Sift together flour, salt, and baking soda. <p /> 3) And in another bowl, mash bananas. <p /> 4) Mix 1 cup sifted dry ingredients into the creamed sugar / oil mixture <p /> 5) Add 1/2 the mashed bananas, mix <p /> 6) Repeat steps 4 & 5 with remaining ingredients, and toss in Raisins and mix. Pour into greased/floured bread pan. <p /> I bake the bread for 30 minutes at 350, then cover loosely with foil and bake for around another 20 minutes. Check with a toothpick and when it comes clean it is ready.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Memorial weekend most definitely conjured up memories for me.</p>
<p>Even though the weekend started out with an unexpected twist - Becky staying home due to a stomach bug - and was a quite busy one overall - there were a few moments where memories from the past came rushing back to me like a dream sequence.</p>
<p>When I first walked into my parents house, my eyes kept darting to the back door, looking for the pups there waiting to come in - or eagerly waiting for a handout from Grandma :). &nbsp;This dream of a memory happened numerous times during my visit.</p>
<p>Sorrow of missing friends no longer around was quickly hidden away by the creation of wonderful new memories - ones that I&#8217;m sure someday will come back to me and spark similar nostalgia when I walk through those doors.</p>
<p>Memories of the smiles shared with grandparents, playing with cousins, and laughter and happiness.</p>
<p>Before I set out for the long drive home (360 miles with two kids is daunting), I walked back to a dreamscape. &nbsp;I visited the meadow we often went to with our friends&#8230; though the grass was green and lush from the spring rains, my mind quickly turned it dry, and a breeze whisked through the tall grass.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/2012-05-31-memories-and-dreams/4238cb92aa7111e180d51231380fcd7e_7.jpg"></p>
<p>I walked through the tall dry grass just like Chinook loved to do - felt it touch my skin and lived the memory as a dream all over again. &nbsp;Big doggie smiles, loving the moment. &nbsp;I missed them all: Becky, Sophie, and Chinook, but they were with me there in that moment. &nbsp;In that dream.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I find that writing helps me cope with sorrow. &nbsp;And since my life has served me up a massive dump truck of sorrow in the past day, here is a blog post about the source of the sorrow: the departure of one of my best friends: Chinook.<p><img src="imgs/2012-04-11-lessons-from-a-dog/533932_10150942111544129_671494128_13115684_1541681598_n.jpg"></p></p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>I have <a href="http://timmyc.posterous.com/decade-of-doodoo">blogged about Chinook before</a>&nbsp;but for those just joining into my story, or to be hip, the tl;dr; (meaning of tl;dr; for my mom: too long, didn&#8217;t read) version will be dropped right here. &nbsp;Chinook was &#8220;the best birthday present ever&#8221; that I gave to my then girlfriend, now wife, Becky, about 11 and a half years ago.</p>
<p>As Becky put it, our lives as &#8220;grown ups&#8221; (I chuckle at that term, though I guess I am grown up) have always had Chinook in it. &nbsp;Any dog owner/lover knows, our pets are such a huge part of our lives.. and at many darker points in our journeys, dogs can often be our only source of hope.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that old post sums up a good part of the history of Chinook. &nbsp;But in death, saddly enough, we often discover just how important someone, or in this case, a dog is to our lives.</p>
<p>Last night I held Chinook&#8217;s big head while he went to sleep, and took his last breath, and through the tears ( I have sobbed so freaking much, and will obviously continue to do so ), and *so many* happy memories I kept realizing I have learned so much from my best buddy Chinook.</p>
<p>So, as an ode to the life of my buddy, my amazingly awesome big ass dog, I want to jot down some of the things he taught me. &nbsp;Because these lessons are gold, and if followed, hopefully I too can live a long life full of hapiness like he did.</p>
<h2>Size Matters</h2>
<p>Chinook was a big boy. &nbsp;He tipped the scales, that is when he would even lay paw in the dr&#8217;s office, at over 145lbs. &nbsp;But the beauty of him was he was so gentle and loving for his size. &nbsp;And the only thing that was bigger than his physial size (and massive head) was the love he would pour out on anyone around him.</p>
<p>Love big, love often. &nbsp;Size does matter when it comes to the love you give others.</p>
<h2>Be a Leaner</h2>
<p>Another awesome thing Chinook would do was to come up to nearly anyone sitting on a chair or a couch, and sit directly on their feet. &nbsp;This many times resulted in &#8220;brown ones&#8221; on a pair of socks, but more importnatly, Chinook would then lean into you, and beg for love.</p>
<p>To borrow from the lyrics of an epic 80&#8217;s song, we all need someone to lean on from time to time. &nbsp;Looking back over my various jobs, and other aspects of my life, I can distinctly point out times where if I simply would have been a &#8216;leaner&#8217; like Chinook, the rough road I was traveling on would have been so much smoother.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people you can saunter up to and lean on&#8230; make yourself available for them to lean back on you as well. &nbsp;Just don&#8217;t leave brown ones.</p>
<h2>Okay to be Scared</h2>
<p>Even if you are a big dog, life can be freaking scary at times. &nbsp;Chinook was quite possibly the biggest wimp dog ever. &nbsp;Thunder, fireworks, doorways, wind, you name it, Chinook was spooked easily.</p>
<p>Simply put though, life throws some scary stuff at us. &nbsp;Getting married, starting a new job, having kids, and making hard decisions like putting a dog down suck, and are scary. &nbsp;Its okay to be scared, and when scared, find the nearest foot to sit on.</p>
<p>(side note: tonight I was out front of our house, and there were three loud claps of thunder over a five minute span. &nbsp;I was elated. &nbsp;I ran inside and told Becky. &nbsp;I was so happy Chinook didn&#8217;t hear the thunder and also I thought it was a sign. &nbsp;Call me crazy. I don&#8217;t care )</p>
<h2>Most Importantly: Live In The Now</h2>
<p>Hands down the biggest thing I learned from Chinook, and am still trying to perfect, is living in the now. &nbsp;Chinook was stoked in the moment. &nbsp;He was present whether lounging on the carpet, or chilling in the shade during a hot summer hike.</p>
<p>In the era of pads, smart phones, and the interwebs, we are bombarded with distractions that prevent us from fully living in the moment. &nbsp;I know the times I am happiest are when all that noise is off, and I&#8217;m out in nature, living in the present.</p>
<p>He helped me live in the now on a daily basis. &nbsp;Sometimes we would wrestle on the ground, other times we would spoon, whatever it was, we just enjoyed eachother. &nbsp;Living in the moment with those around you, those you love, is such a beautiful thing that we should all practice more often.</p>
<p>But even bigger here is you never know how many moments you will be blessed with from a particular person, or pet. &nbsp;Life is fragile and precious, soak up each opportunity you have with those you love, and savor it.</p>
<h2>Lessons From My Friend</h2>
<p>Chinook was so much more than a dog. &nbsp;And the lessons he taught me and others are much greater than this quick list. &nbsp;The love he gave me was so wonderful, and I miss him very much. &nbsp;So grab someone (human/canine) and hold them tight, and tell them you love them, and remind them of how much they mean to you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My lovely wife has introduced me to many things over the past 10 years - but after this week, I think the greatest of these is the concept of &#8220;Birthday Month&#8221;.</p>
<p>Everyone loves birthdays, but Becky is especially keen on them. &nbsp;So much so that she likes to spread the celebration much longer than just a day, in fact she likes to observe the date for the entire month.</p>
<p>So here I am, winding down my 35th birthday month, and the past week(ish) has simply been awesome.</p>
<p>A week ago I was shredding pow in B.C. with my good friend Jon, and today, I skiined up my favorite little butte in a blizzard.</p>
<p>Between here and ther my girls threw me a pimpin birthday party (complete with a 35 candle cake), I spoke at Ignite Bend, and got to spend a lovely daddy Friday with my two littlest girls.</p>
<p>So the stoke carried on today over miles of sledneck fash shots, a great little lap down botomless pow, and the first descent of the Sheridan Shelter.</p>
<p>Birthday Month, FTW.</p>
