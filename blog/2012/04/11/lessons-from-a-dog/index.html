<div class="entry-content"><p>I find that writing helps me cope with sorrow. &nbsp;And since my life has served me up a massive dump truck of sorrow in the past day, here is a blog post about the source of the sorrow: the departure of one of my best friends: Chinook.<p><img src="imgs/2012-04-11-lessons-from-a-dog/533932_10150942111544129_671494128_13115684_1541681598_n.jpg"></p></p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>I have <a href="http://timmyc.posterous.com/decade-of-doodoo">blogged about Chinook before</a>&nbsp;but for those just joining into my story, or to be hip, the tl;dr; (meaning of tl;dr; for my mom: too long, didn&#8217;t read) version will be dropped right here. &nbsp;Chinook was &#8220;the best birthday present ever&#8221; that I gave to my then girlfriend, now wife, Becky, about 11 and a half years ago.</p>
<p>As Becky put it, our lives as &#8220;grown ups&#8221; (I chuckle at that term, though I guess I am grown up) have always had Chinook in it. &nbsp;Any dog owner/lover knows, our pets are such a huge part of our lives.. and at many darker points in our journeys, dogs can often be our only source of hope.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that old post sums up a good part of the history of Chinook. &nbsp;But in death, saddly enough, we often discover just how important someone, or in this case, a dog is to our lives.</p>
<p>Last night I held Chinook&#8217;s big head while he went to sleep, and took his last breath, and through the tears ( I have sobbed so freaking much, and will obviously continue to do so ), and *so many* happy memories I kept realizing I have learned so much from my best buddy Chinook.</p>
<p>So, as an ode to the life of my buddy, my amazingly awesome big ass dog, I want to jot down some of the things he taught me. &nbsp;Because these lessons are gold, and if followed, hopefully I too can live a long life full of hapiness like he did.</p>
<h2>Size Matters</h2>
<p>Chinook was a big boy. &nbsp;He tipped the scales, that is when he would even lay paw in the dr&#8217;s office, at over 145lbs. &nbsp;But the beauty of him was he was so gentle and loving for his size. &nbsp;And the only thing that was bigger than his physial size (and massive head) was the love he would pour out on anyone around him.</p>
<p>Love big, love often. &nbsp;Size does matter when it comes to the love you give others.</p>
<h2>Be a Leaner</h2>
<p>Another awesome thing Chinook would do was to come up to nearly anyone sitting on a chair or a couch, and sit directly on their feet. &nbsp;This many times resulted in &#8220;brown ones&#8221; on a pair of socks, but more importnatly, Chinook would then lean into you, and beg for love.</p>
<p>To borrow from the lyrics of an epic 80&#8217;s song, we all need someone to lean on from time to time. &nbsp;Looking back over my various jobs, and other aspects of my life, I can distinctly point out times where if I simply would have been a &#8216;leaner&#8217; like Chinook, the rough road I was traveling on would have been so much smoother.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people you can saunter up to and lean on&#8230; make yourself available for them to lean back on you as well. &nbsp;Just don&#8217;t leave brown ones.</p>
<h2>Okay to be Scared</h2>
<p>Even if you are a big dog, life can be freaking scary at times. &nbsp;Chinook was quite possibly the biggest wimp dog ever. &nbsp;Thunder, fireworks, doorways, wind, you name it, Chinook was spooked easily.</p>
<p>Simply put though, life throws some scary stuff at us. &nbsp;Getting married, starting a new job, having kids, and making hard decisions like putting a dog down suck, and are scary. &nbsp;Its okay to be scared, and when scared, find the nearest foot to sit on.</p>
<p>(side note: tonight I was out front of our house, and there were three loud claps of thunder over a five minute span. &nbsp;I was elated. &nbsp;I ran inside and told Becky. &nbsp;I was so happy Chinook didn&#8217;t hear the thunder and also I thought it was a sign. &nbsp;Call me crazy. I don&#8217;t care )</p>
<h2>Most Importantly: Live In The Now</h2>
<p>Hands down the biggest thing I learned from Chinook, and am still trying to perfect, is living in the now. &nbsp;Chinook was stoked in the moment. &nbsp;He was present whether lounging on the carpet, or chilling in the shade during a hot summer hike.</p>
<p>In the era of pads, smart phones, and the interwebs, we are bombarded with distractions that prevent us from fully living in the moment. &nbsp;I know the times I am happiest are when all that noise is off, and I&#8217;m out in nature, living in the present.</p>
<p>He helped me live in the now on a daily basis. &nbsp;Sometimes we would wrestle on the ground, other times we would spoon, whatever it was, we just enjoyed eachother. &nbsp;Living in the moment with those around you, those you love, is such a beautiful thing that we should all practice more often.</p>
<p>But even bigger here is you never know how many moments you will be blessed with from a particular person, or pet. &nbsp;Life is fragile and precious, soak up each opportunity you have with those you love, and savor it.</p>
<h2>Lessons From My Friend</h2>
<p>Chinook was so much more than a dog. &nbsp;And the lessons he taught me and others are much greater than this quick list. &nbsp;The love he gave me was so wonderful, and I miss him very much. &nbsp;So grab someone (human/canine) and hold them tight, and tell them you love them, and remind them of how much they mean to you.</p>
